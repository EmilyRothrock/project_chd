It is usually caused by a build-up of plaque in the vessel wall that causes the coronary arteries to narrow, limiting blood flow. The purpose of this project is to build a predictive algorithm that can predict the likelihood a person develops CHD.\n","\n","\n","These models will be built using a subset of data from the Framingham Heart Study, split into a training and testing set. Tools learned in class such as k nearest neighbor, linear regression, and decision trees were explored to assess which model was the most viable. Through cleaning data, transforming variables, and building models, we attempted to uncover the highest possible R-squared value, or the model that is most suitable for a clinical setting. The idea of this approach is to train the model on the variable attributes/factors most correlated with developing CHD. Then, the model will be tested on its accuracy of prediciting the risk of CHD from an input of those specific variables from a different testing dataset.\n","\n","\n","Results: After running these various models, we found that _____ performed the best, with an R-squared value of _____ (or RMSE).
